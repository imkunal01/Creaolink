🧱 OVERALL PHASE STRUCTURE

We’ll build in 6 phases:

Foundation & Auth

Core Marketplace (Editors + Clients)

Projects & Versioning (Heart of CreaoLink)

Feedback, Approval & Workflow

Differentiators (Killer Features)

Hardening, Cleanup & Pitch-Ready

Each phase has:

🎯 Goal

🧠 What you’re building

🧩 Exact vibe-coding prompt

🔹 PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION & AUTH (DO NOT SKIP)
🎯 Goal

Get a working skeleton that you won’t regret later.

🧠 Build

Next.js app (App Router)

PostgreSQL schema

Auth (simple but clean)

Role-based access (Client / Editor)

Tables

users

profiles

roles

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 1
Act as a senior full-stack engineer.

Set up a Next.js (App Router) project with:
- Node.js backend routes
- PostgreSQL database
- Simple email + password authentication
- Two roles: CLIENT and EDITOR

Requirements:
- Secure auth (hash passwords)
- Session-based or JWT (your choice, but explain)
- Role-based route protection
- Minimal UI (Tailwind OK)
- PostgreSQL schema for users, roles, profiles

Focus on correctness, not UI beauty.
Give me:
1. Database schema
2. API routes
3. Folder structure
4. Basic auth flow explanation


✅ Output = stable base

🔹 PHASE 2 — EDITOR MARKETPLACE (VISIBLE VALUE)
🎯 Goal

Make something users can see and click.

🧠 Build

Editor profiles

Skill tags

Portfolio (YouTube embeds)

Search & filter

Tables

editor_profiles

skills

editor_skills

portfolio_items

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 2
You are building the editor marketplace for CreaoLink.

Implement:
- Editor public profile page
- Skill tags (style-based, not tools)
- Portfolio section with YouTube video embeds
- Editor listing page with filters:
  - Skill
  - Rating (dummy for now)

Tech constraints:
- Next.js frontend
- Node API
- PostgreSQL schema
- No payment yet

Provide:
1. DB schema
2. API endpoints
3. Example Next.js pages
4. Simple seed data

Keep it MVP-grade, not enterprise.


🔥 At this point, CreaoLink already beats Fiverr visually.

🔹 PHASE 3 — PROJECTS & VERSIONING (CORE DNA)
🎯 Goal

Build the actual product, not a marketplace clone.

🧠 Build

Project creation

File uploads

Assign editors

Version history (metadata-based)

Tables

projects

project_members

video_versions

uploads

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 3
Design and implement the core project workflow for CreaoLink.

Features:
- Client creates a project
- Uploads raw video
- Assigns editors to the project
- Editors upload video versions
- Maintain version history (no diffing, just metadata)

Constraints:
- No real-time editing
- No video processing
- Just file upload + version tracking

Deliver:
1. Clean PostgreSQL schema
2. REST API design
3. Example version history response
4. UI flow (page-by-page)

Focus on correctness and extensibility.


🚨 This phase is your moat.

🔹 PHASE 4 — FEEDBACK, APPROVAL & CONTROL
🎯 Goal

Kill WhatsApp + email chaos.

🧠 Build

Timestamp-based comments

Approval system

Revision limits

Final lock

Tables

comments

approvals

revisions

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 4
Implement client feedback and approval workflow for video projects.

Features:
- Timestamp-based comments on video versions
- Editor replies to comments
- Client can approve or request revision
- Revision count limit
- Once approved, version becomes FINAL and locked

Requirements:
- Clear state machine (DRAFT → REVIEW → FINAL)
- API endpoints for comments and approvals
- UI logic explanation

Design it so there is zero ambiguity.


💥 This is where clients fall in love.

🔹 PHASE 5 — KILLER DIFFERENTIATORS (STAND-OUT)

Pick ONLY these 3 for MVP:

Timeline comments

Client readiness score

Editor recommendation reasoning

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 5A (Timeline Comments)
Extend the comment system to support timeline-based feedback.

Requirements:
- Comment tied to video timestamp (seconds)
- UI logic for placing comment on timeline
- Sorted playback comments
- Editor notification on new comment

Focus on clean data modeling and UX logic.

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 5B (Client Readiness Score)
Design a Client Readiness Score system.

Inputs:
- Response time
- Approval speed
- Revision abuse
- Project completion rate

Output:
- Score visible to editors before accepting work

Deliver:
- Scoring formula
- Database schema
- API
- UI placement

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 5C (Why This Editor?)
Implement transparent editor recommendations.

For each recommended editor, show:
- Reason for recommendation
- Matching skills
- Past similar projects

No ML required.
Use rule-based logic.

Deliver schema, API, and UI logic.

🔹 PHASE 6 — HARDENING & POLISH (SHIP-READY)
🎯 Goal

Make it demoable, stable, resume-worthy.

🧠 Build

Error handling

Access control

Seed demo data

UX cleanup

🧩 PROMPT — Phase 6
Audit the CreaoLink codebase for:
- Security issues
- Broken flows
- Missing edge cases
- Bad UX assumptions

Suggest:
- Fixes
- Refactors
- MVP-ready improvements

Think like a startup reviewer or investor.
